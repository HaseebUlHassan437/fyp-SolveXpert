3.  **Install Python Dependencies:**
    Install all required Python libraries using the `requirements.txt` file.

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Database Configuration (MySQL with XAMPP):**

      * Start **Apache** and **MySQL** services from your XAMPP control panel.

      * Access `phpMyAdmin` (usually `http://localhost/phpmyadmin/`) through your browser.

      * Create a new database for SolveXpert (e.g., `solvexpert_db`).

      * Open the `fyp-SolveXpert/solvexpert/settings.py` file.

      * Locate the `DATABASES` setting and update it with your MySQL credentials, ensuring the `NAME` matches your created database name.

        ```python
        DATABASES = {
            'default': {
                'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.mysql',
                'NAME': 'solvexpert_db', # Your database name
